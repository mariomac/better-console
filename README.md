Better Console
==============

This simple library (in Spanish language) has done for my first-year students at (Technical University of Catalonia)[http://www.upc.cat]. It adds to the Linux and Mac console the next functionalities:

* Specify foreground and background color for the printed text
* Clear screen
* Specify coordinates in the screen to print to.
* Retrieve console screen size (rows and columns)

It includes some utilization examples.
